<h1>What do you mean?</h1>
<h4>DALAS uses machine learning to predict and see if you are distracted and if your eyes are not focused on driving.</h4>
<h4>DALAS is a launcher, so that means it runs on top of your default Android.</h4>
<h4>The first project of campaign Take Me To The Summer 2022.</h4>
<h4>More about the campaign on our website.</h4>
<h1>Features of DALAS Launcher</h1>
<h2>Changelog 0.0.1</h2>
Face and eye prediction;<br>
Weather checking;<br>
Spotify integrated along with GMaps;<br>
Battery temperature control.<br>
<h3>Everything you need to modernize one old ass car.</h3>
<p>You don't need to buy expensive trash car dashboards, you already have it in your pocket!</p>
<p>DALAS uses Tensorflow ( i know , bad choice ), but it can easily be modified to your needs.</p>
<p>It also utilizes C++ for backend , you know , when Java is too crappy.</p>
<p>To be honest , java is always too crapy, so I'm thinking about DALAS OS to replace this launcher.</p>

<h1>How to install and use DALAS?</h1>

<p>*Currently* we are waiting for an approve on Play Store, while that happens, it is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Compile DALAS project, or use precompiled apk's.</p>
<p>Before installing apks, install Spotify and GMaps, because our install.py will not do it for you (for now)</p>
<p>Install apk and enjoy! Safe driving!</p>
